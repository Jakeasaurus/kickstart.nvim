# New Enhanced Features Added

## üéâ Recently Added Core Functionality

Your Neovim configuration has been enhanced with three essential plugins that significantly improve the development experience:

---

## 1. üí¨ **Smart Commenting - Comment.nvim**

### **What it does:**
Intelligent comment toggling for all programming languages with proper syntax awareness.

### **Key Features:**
- **Language-aware**: Automatically uses correct comment syntax for each language
- **Multiple modes**: Line comments, block comments, and partial line comments
- **Smart selection**: Works in visual mode for commenting blocks of code

### **Usage:**
```vim
gcc     " Toggle line comment
gbc     " Toggle block comment  
gc{motion}  " Comment with motion (e.g., gcap for paragraph)
gb{motion}  " Block comment with motion

" Visual mode
gc      " Comment selected lines
gb      " Block comment selection

" Extra commands
gco     " Add comment below current line
gcO     " Add comment above current line  
gcA     " Add comment at end of line
```

## 2. üìã **Buffer Management - bufferline.nvim**

### **What it does:**
Visual buffer tabs at the top of your editor with advanced buffer management features.

### **Key Features:**
- **Visual buffer bar**: See all open buffers as tabs
- **LSP integration**: Shows diagnostics and file types
- **Smart sorting**: Buffers organized intelligently
- **Pin functionality**: Pin important buffers

### **Usage:**
```vim
Shift+h     " Previous buffer
Shift+l     " Next buffer

" Buffer management (all start with <leader>b):
<leader>bd  " Delete current buffer
<leader>bo  " Delete all other buffers  
<leader>bp  " Pin/unpin current buffer
<leader>bP  " Delete all non-pinned buffers
<leader>br  " Delete buffers to the right
<leader>bl  " Delete buffers to the left
```

### **Visual Features:**
- üî¥ Modified indicator for unsaved files
- üéØ LSP diagnostics (errors/warnings) shown on tabs
- üìÅ File type icons for easy identification
- üìå Pin icon for important buffers

## 3. üéØ **Enhanced Code Navigation - nvim-treesitter-textobjects**

### **What it does:**
Code-aware text objects and navigation based on syntax tree understanding.

### **Key Features:**
- **Smart selection**: Select functions, classes, parameters by meaning
- **Code navigation**: Jump between code constructs
- **Parameter swapping**: Swap function arguments intelligently

### **Text Object Selection:**
```vim
" Select around/inside (use 'a' for around, 'i' for inside):
af/if   " Function
ac/ic   " Class  
aa/ia   " Parameter/argument
ab/ib   " Block (e.g., if block, loop block)
al/il   " Loop
ai/ii   " Conditional (if statement)
am/im   " Comment
```

### **Code Navigation:**
```vim
" Jump to next/previous code constructs:
]f/[f   " Next/previous function start
]F/[F   " Next/previous function end
]c/[c   " Next/previous class
]a/[a   " Next/previous parameter
]b/[b   " Next/previous block
]l/[l   " Next/previous loop  
]i/[i   " Next/previous conditional
]m/[m   " Next/previous comment
```

### **Smart Code Manipulation:**
```vim
" Swap code elements:
<leader>na  " Swap current parameter with next
<leader>pa  " Swap current parameter with previous  
<leader>nf  " Swap current function with next
<leader>pf  " Swap current function with previous
```

## üìö **Example Workflows**

### **Commenting Workflow:**
1. `gcc` - Quick toggle comment on current line
2. `gcap` - Comment entire paragraph
3. `gc3j` - Comment current line + 3 lines down
4. Visual select + `gc` - Comment selected block

### **Buffer Management Workflow:**
1. `Shift+h/l` - Quick buffer switching
2. `<leader>bo` - Clean workspace (close other buffers)
3. `<leader>bp` - Pin important files
4. `<leader>bd` - Close current buffer when done

### **Code Navigation Workflow:**
1. `]f` - Jump to next function
2. `vaf` - Select entire function for copy/move
3. `dac` - Delete entire class
4. `<leader>na` - Swap function parameters

---

## üöÄ **Getting Started**

1. **Restart Neovim** - Lazy.nvim will automatically install the new plugins
2. **Try commenting** - Open a file and press `gcc` to test
3. **Check buffer line** - Open multiple files to see the buffer tabs
4. **Test text objects** - Try `vaf` in a function to select it

Your development workflow is now significantly more powerful! üéâ
